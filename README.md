# X-HEEP-based FPGA EMUlation Platform (FEMU)

We ported our custom [eXtendable Heterogeneous Energy-Efficient Platform (X-HEEP)](https://github.com/esl-epfl/x-heep) microcontroller to the TUL Pynq-Z2 board, based on the Xilinx Zynq-7020 chip, in order to realize a valuable FPGA-based emulation platform for performing software explorations of ultra-low-power edge-computing applications.

## Requirements

The needed material for using our FPGA platform is the following:

 - a [TUL Pynq-Z2](https://www.tulembedded.com/fpga/ProductsPYNQ-Z2.html) with power supply.
 - A Micro USB cable.
 - A Ethernet cable.
 - A MicroSD card with at least 16GB of memory.
 - A PC (the Linux operating system is suggested) with a Web browser installed.

## Setup

Follow these steps to get started with our FPGA platform:

 1. Download our pre-compiled PetaLinux-based image from this Drive [FEMU MicroSD Image](http://tiny.cc/femu_microsd_image) and load it to your MicroSD card. You can find more information about the writing process in this documentation: [Write SD card](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix/sdcard.html).
 2. Insert your MicroSD card in your Pynq-Z2 board and make sure the boot jumper is in the SD position. Then, power up the board.
 3. You can now connect to the board.

## Board connection

You can access Linux running on the board in the following 3 ways:

**USB (terminal)**
Connect your PC to the board using the Micro USB cable and run this command from your terminal:
```
sudo screen /dev/<your_usb_dev_name> 115200
```
NOTE: this method has several limitations and is suggested only for quick initial configurations.

**Ethernet (terminal)**
Connect the board to the same network of your PC using the Ethernet cable. The Linux ETH interface has the assigned static IP address `192.168.2.99` for direct connections, but can also be configured through DHCP, for router connections. Once you know the IP address of your board, run the following command from your terminal:
```
ssh -X xilinx@<board_ip>
```
**Ethernet (browser)**
Connect the board to the same network of your PC using the Ethernet cable (as explained in the previous paragraph). Then, open your browser and navigate to `<board_ip>:9090` to open the Jupyter environment.

NOTE: the Linux username and password are `xilinx` and `xilinx`, respectively.

## Download SDK

Connect to the board using the `Ethernet` way. Then, navigate to your `home` directory and run this command from your terminal to download the Software Development Kit (SDK):
```
git clone https://github.com/simone-machetti/x-heep-femu-sdk.git
```

## Software exploration

Read our `Read the Docs` documentation at the following link to learn in detail how to run your own applications on our FPGA platform and enjoy all its software exploration functionalities: [FEMU Documentation](http://tiny.cc/femu_documentation).

## Modify the hardware

This section quickly describes the content of this repository, so that you may be able to modify the hardware if needed.

The **imp/** folder is organized as follows:

 - **rtl/** contains the RTL code of our platform top-level and of all the modules that are instantiated outside X-HEEP.
 - **scripts/** contains the TCL script to automatically generate the Vivado block design of our platform.
 - **pads/** contains the HJSON configuration file to automatically generate the pad ring and pad controller of our platform.
 - **pinout/** contains the Vivado XDC constraints file to specify the pinout of our platform.
 - **vendor/** contains our cloned and patched X-HEEP repository.

Navigate to the **imp/** folder and run the following commands to generate our platform hardware.

NOTE: the following commands can ONLY be run inside our X-HEEP Conda environment. Please, refer to our [X-HEEP documentation](https://github.com/esl-epfl/x-heep) to learn how to configure it.

This command uses the [Vendor](https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/vendor_hw/) tool to clone and patch our X-HEEP repository so that we can use its hardware and software in our FPGA platform.
```
make femu-gen-vendor
```
This command configures our architecture to generate the required RTL files.
```
make femu-gen-rtl
```
This command runs [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) to generate the required scripts and then runs Vivado to synthesize and implement our design.
```
make femu-gen-vivado
```
